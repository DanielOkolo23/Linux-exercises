<B> 193.16.20.35/29 <B>
 <br>
 <ul> <B> What is the Network IP, number of hosts, range of IP addresses and broadcast IP from this subnet? <B> </ul>
  <br>
193.16.20.35 = 11000001.10101000.00010100.00100011
 29 = 1111111.11111111.11111111.11111000
  255.255.255.248
  To get the Network ID we will compare the fourth octet between the given ip converted to binary and subnet mask 
  which gave us = 00100000
  If we convert this binary format we will get 32 
  which gives us the fourth octet for our network ip below
<B> Network IP=193.16.20.32 <B>
 <br>
<B> Number of hosts=6 <B>
  <br>
<B> Range of IP addresses=193.16.20.33 - 193.16.20.38 <B>
  <br>
<B> Broadcast IP=193.16.20.39 <B>
